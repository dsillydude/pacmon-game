# Farcaster Mini-App Build Assistance - Final Summary

## Project Overview
Successfully analyzed and fixed a Pac-Man game built as a Farcaster mini-app called "PACMON" that integrates with the Monad blockchain for score submission and leaderboard functionality.

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### ✅ Critical Build Errors Fixed
