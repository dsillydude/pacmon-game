# Pacmon Game Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the Pacmon game to enhance gameplay mechanics with progressive difficulty levels, starting with smaller mazes and fewer ghosts, then increasing complexity as levels progress.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Progressive Difficulty System

#### Level Settings (lib/difficultySettings.ts)
- **Level 1**: 7x7 maze, 1 ghost, 10 dots - Perfect for beginners
- **Level 2**: 9x9 maze, 1 ghost, 15 dots - Slightly larger maze
- **Level 3**: 11x11 maze, 2 ghosts, 20 dots - Introduction of second ghost
- **Level 4**: 13x13 maze, 2 ghosts, 25 dots - Larger maze with more challenge
- **Level 5**: 15x15 maze, 3 ghosts, 30 dots - Significant difficulty increase
- **Level 6**: 17x17 maze, 3 ghosts, 35 dots - Even larger maze
- **Level 7**: 19x19 maze, 4 ghosts, 40 dots - Maximum difficulty

#### Ghost Speed Progression
- Level 1: Speed 1.0 (base speed)
- Level 2: Speed 1.2 (20% faster)
- Level 3: Speed 1.4 (40% faster)
- Level 4: Speed 1.6 (60% faster)
- Level 5: Speed 1.8 (80% faster)
- Level 6: Speed 2.0 (100% faster)
- Level 7: Speed 2.2 (120% faster)

### 2. Dynamic Maze Generation (lib/mazeGenerator.ts)

#### Improved Maze Algorithm
- **Simple Maze Generation** for levels 1-2: Clear, easy-to-navigate paths
- **Complex Maze Generation** for levels 3+: More challenging layouts with better connectivity
- **Proper Spawn Points**: Ensures player and ghosts spawn in valid, accessible locations
- **Balanced Pellet Distribution**: Appropriate number of pellets and power pellets per level

#### Maze Features
- Walls are properly generated to create challenging but fair layouts
- Power pellets are strategically placed
- Ghost spawn points are positioned to provide appropriate challenge
- Player spawn point is always in a safe, accessible location

### 3. Enhanced Game Components

#### New Improved Game Component (components/PacmonGameImproved.tsx)
- **Level Progression System**: Automatic advancement to next level when all pellets collected
- **Level Transition Effects**: Visual overlay showing level completion and next level
- **Dynamic Canvas Sizing**: Game canvas adjusts to maze size for optimal display
- **Enhanced UI**: Shows current level, score, lives, and power mode timer
- **Mobile Controls**: Touch-friendly directional buttons for mobile gameplay

#### Test Demo Component (components/PacmonGameTestDemo.tsx)
- Simplified version for testing without wallet connection requirements
- Demonstrates all new features and mechanics
- Perfect for development and testing purposes

### 4. Game Mechanics Improvements

#### Level Progression
- **Completion Bonus**: 100 points × level number when completing a level
- **Carry-over System**: Score and lives persist between levels
- **Transition Timing**: 2-second delay between levels for visual feedback
- **Progressive Challenge**: Each level introduces new challenges gradually

#### Enhanced Ghost AI
- **Power Mode Behavior**: Ghosts become vulnerable and move randomly when power pellet is consumed
- **Return Mechanism**: Eaten ghosts return to center spawn point
- **Collision Detection**: Improved collision handling for ghost-player interactions
- **Speed Scaling**: Ghost movement speed increases with level difficulty

#### Improved Controls
- **Keyboard Support**: Arrow keys and WASD for movement
- **Mobile Touch Controls**: Large, responsive directional buttons
- **Wall Collision**: Proper wall detection prevents invalid moves
- **Smooth Movement**: Consistent movement timing and responsiveness

### 5. Visual and UI Enhancements

#### Game Display
- **Responsive Canvas**: Automatically adjusts to maze size
- **Level Indicator**: Clear display of current level in game UI
- **Power Mode Timer**: Visual countdown for power pellet effects
- **Transition Overlays**: Smooth level completion animations

#### Color Scheme
- Maintained original Monad color palette
- **MONAD_PURPLE**: Primary game elements
- **MONAD_BLUE**: Maze walls
- **MONAD_BERRY**: Ghosts and accents
- **MONAD_OFF_WHITE**: Pellets and text

### 6. Code Architecture Improvements

#### Modular Design
- **Separated Concerns**: Game logic, maze generation, and difficulty settings in separate modules
- **Reusable Components**: Improved game component can be used in different contexts
- **Clean Interfaces**: Well-defined TypeScript interfaces for game entities
- **Maintainable Code**: Clear structure and documentation

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient Rendering**: Canvas updates only when necessary
- **Optimized Game Loop**: 200ms intervals for smooth gameplay
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of intervals and event listeners
